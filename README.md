# cgfx

C++ library for next-gen graphics, back-ends, this is prototype code, there be dragons, no guarantees.

Note: Mainly playing around with ideas on how to lessen dependencies (code <--> data) that are very common when using C++ clas inheritance, and virtual functions.

## back-ends

- [X] DX12
- [X] Metal
- [X] Mock
- [ ] Vulkan (Planned)
